# MealMatch: Simplifying Meal Planning and Grocery Shopping

MealMatch is a mobile application that streamlines meal planning and grocery shopping. We've all been there, it's Sunday night, you're sitting in your car in the parking lot at Trader Joe's, and you need to get your grocery shopping done before the start of the week. You're pressed for time, you've got work in the morning, and the "Sunday Scaries" are setting in. Who's got any brain power left to think about what they want to eat for the week and then turn that into a grocery list?

That's why I made Meal Match! Track your regular meals & grocery items, select what sounds good to you, then click "Generate Grocery List" and _VOILA!_, you've got a grocery list with everything you need, ordered by where it is in the store. No need to worry about food any more, Meal Match can carry some of the burden of _adulting_. Save time, save energy, and get back to living your life!
